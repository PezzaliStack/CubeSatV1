## 🛰️ PayloadX Edition – by PezzaliStack

This is a **technical fork** of the EdgeFlyte CubeSat v1 project.  
It is maintained by **PezzaliStack** as part of the **PayloadX initiative**:  
a modular, open-source CubeSat system for education, prototyping, and hands-on aerospace development.

### 📦 Goals of this fork:
- Refactor the monolithic code into clean modules (`imu.cpp`, `gps.cpp`, `bms.cpp`, etc.)
- Integrate telemetry with a **PWA-based Ground Station**
- Prepare the structure for future hardware simulations and real payload launches
- Keep all contributions within the scope of the [GPL v3 License](./LICENSE)
